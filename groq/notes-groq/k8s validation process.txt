# rack validation process

# pre validation

1 - create tracking spreadsheet
2 - create Jira epic

# actual validation
1 - check bios version
kubectl-list bios-version | grep <rack>-
	1.1 - update bios if version isn't 2.8.v2

2 - check rack status
kubectl-check-racks <rack> <rack> <rack>

3 - go to working dir
k8s (~/git/infrastructure-platform-cluster/scripts/hw_validation)

4 - check for missing optics
ONLY_TESTS=missing-optics ./run.sh -t xt <rack>

5 - submit tickets for missing optics

6 - validate optics are updated and look good
kubectl-check-racks <rack> <rack> <rack>
	6.1 - if optics are out of date, delete tspd pod and recheck

7 - run validation
./run.sh -t xt <rack>

Some failures were identified. To inspect the logs, run:
validationcli logs fetch --validation c1r2

Importantly - when looking for node/rack status, this will NOT consider manually triggered test runs - only the full system qualification runs.

### Fetching logs

Currently you need to know the name of the validation to get logs, but that’s straightforward.

“c1r1-gn1” for node level validations.

“c1r1” for rack level validations.

“c1r1-c1r2” for cross-rack validations.

# Show the logs for the most recent retry of any failed job in the validation
$ kubectl validation logs fetch --validation c1r1-c1r2

# See what logs are available for a validation

### Retry a hardware qualification test from the point of failure

```bash
$ kubectl validation retry --node c1r2-gn5
Node c1r2-gn5 failed groq-sweep-xt4444-8c for scope c1r2-gn5 after 3 retries.
Retry? (y/n): y
Validation status for groq-sweep-xt4444-8c on c1r2-gn5 has been reset. Monitor new progress with
`validation status --node c1r2-gn5`

$ kubectl validation retry --manual-run cholman-c1r2-2025-03-26-1234
(same thing but retrying a manually triggered test run)
```

For use when a test has failed, and maybe we’ve done something simple like reboot, and we want to continue the tests from the point of failure. This will not rerun tests that have already passed. But generally we’d prefer to use the full requalifaction process if we’ve made any changes

### Retry a hardware qualification test from scratch

Rerunning the entire hardware qualification suite will rerun the node, rack, and cross-rack tests. It ensure none of the nodes are being used, then it will remove the validation labels from all involved nodes so that all tests can be repeated.

```bash
$ kubectl validation requalify --node c1r2-gn5
The following actions will be taken:
* Node validation will be removed from c1r2-gn5
* Rack validation will be removed from all nodes in c1r2
* Cross-Rack validation will be removed between c1r1-c1r2 and c1r2-c1r3
Nodes c1r1-gn5 through to c1r3-gn4 will be unavailable for production until the tests pass.

No production workloads detected on these nodes.

Continue? y/n
```

The `GroqValidation` resources required to re-run those test will be deleted so that the GroqNodeController can restart the process from scratch.

The repair (or similar) taint will be applied during the test runs

### Run a specific test(s) manually

```bash
$ kubectl validation manual --nodes c1r3-gn1 --validator node-validation-2
Error: preflight check failed
# TODO: make this output useful
# preflight check failing means either: node has the {node,rack,etc}-complete labels and is not tainted for repair
# or a node has the validation.groq.io/ignore-node label applied

$ kubectl validation manual --nodes c1r1-gn1 --validator node-validation-2

validationcli status --manual-runs manual-cholman-20250416122314

$ kubectl validation status --manual-runs manual-cholman-20250416122314
VALIDATION                      VALIDATOR           SCOPE      RESULT
manual-cholman-20250416122314   node-validation-2   c1r1-gn1   finished

$ kubectl validation logs fetch --validation manual-cholman-20250416122314
# no logs output because this one succeeded, but you get the idea
```

Running a manual run does not impact the validation labels of the nodes. 

The repair taint (or another similar one) is required to exist (unless overridden) during the run to avoid other workloads being scheduled. It can be optionally added as part of the CLI, in which case the taint would be automatically removed upon successful completion.

If this is being used to triage and repair an issue with hardware, the ideal workflow would involve re-running the system qualification suite (with the retry commands above) once the manual run passes in order to prove that the fixer didn’t break something else while fixing the problem.

```bash
kubectl validation status
kubectl validation logs parse --validation c0r7-gn1
kubectl validation retry --validation c0r7-gn1 # retry failing tests
kubectl validation retry --validation c0r7-gn1 --from-start # retry all tests

kc get gv | grep c0r10
kc describe gv c0r10-c0r11
kc validation nudge --validation c0r10-c0r11 # 
kubectl validation retry --validation c0r10-c0r11

```
